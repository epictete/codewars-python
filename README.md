# Codewars in Python

Here is a list of the Python Kata I've trained on.  
You should definitely check out their [website](https://www.codewars.com).  
It's really fun, and it is a great way to learn.  
You will improve both your coding skills and algorithmic thinking.  
You also get to compare your solutions to those of other great coders!
